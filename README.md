# Backend for Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever Replay Analyzer

This project is WIP.
It is the backend for the [faf-replay-analyzer](https://github.com/Needix/faf-replays).

# Getting started

Check out the project and run the ReplayRestApiApplication as a spring boot application. Check the replay endpoints for
more information. This project needs a running database to store the analyzed replays.
